## About
This is a repo for Pea Gameplay's PvZ2C English translation server, used to host the translation file, simplified to just pushing raw file to the directory.

Note: If you want to download the translation patch, this is not a place to do that. Instead, please go to https://github.com/Nvdtn19/nvdtn19-pvz2c-english-patch
